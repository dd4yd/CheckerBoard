## Checkerboard Retrospective

1) I'd like to thing I did fairly well on this Checkerboard assignment. I got just about every aspect 
of it right. Our solutions accomplished (almost the exact same thing). One thing I did differently, and
in my opinion makes more sense logically, is that the Checkerboard correctly resized on the fly. Although
if you drag the window horizontally or vertically (not diag), the checkerboard squares stayed in the shape
of squares, rather then resizing to rectangles like your solution. I think this is a better approach,
as a rectangle checkerboard wouldn't make much sense because the pieces would be equilateral on all sides.

2) I understanded the concepts fairly well. The idea of using a ChangeListener to constantly update the size
of the board was a tad confusing at first, although it truly makes sense now after seeing you implement it 
in class, along with reading the Oracle documentation.

3) I'd like to think I met 100% of the requirements, as every aspect of the challenge was implemented into
my solution.

4) My solution is very similar to the posted solution, with the only difference being that of what I mentioned 
in 1) of my restrospect; my checkerboard only changes size diagonaly, keeping the checkerboard pieces in squares,
rather than resizing them as rectangles when the user drags horizontally or vertically

5) One way I could improve forward is is reading the documentation on Objects or ideas that I'm going to have
to implement before I dive right into the coding and attempt to learn things on the fly. This way I have a much
better understanding of what I'm coding, rather than having to go back and forth between my coding and the
documentation.
